# Purple Caster Minion Functions

This repository contains all programs and information related to any functions within the Purple Caster Minions organization. These include:

## Purple Caster Minions Discord Bot
This code is the implementation details of the bot that runs within the <discord.gg/lolpcm> server.
The bot currently has the functionalities to print out daily questions to the server to increase activity for membership. 
Other functionalities include printing out information to users through different commands and playing within the server.

<b> Goal: </b> The goal for this project is to build a bot to automate many functions within the server to increase club functions and presence within the University of Washington community.


## Workshop
Workshops are hosted at the HUB Games area where we mainly focus on how to code in Python. This course is aimed at developing the technical skills first, and then we will look more in Riot Games' API. The workshop as a whole is to help focus on the educational and professional aspect of Purple Caster Minions to show that esports is also very relative to the main thriving industries in today's age.

### Discord Bot Workshop
The first workshop we hosted was the discord bots workshops. This was a three week course with one hour workshops per week that helped participants set up their Integrated Development Environment (IDE) through PyCharm, downloading the discord.py package, and doing other setup procedures. We then looked into the main commands needed from the package to build a self-sufficient discord beginner bot that we programmed in week 3.

<b>Goal:</b> The goal for this workshop is to educate participants with the skills needed to continue developing the discord bots following the workshops.


### Introduction to Python Workshop
Following the discord bot workshop, we are now hosting a full introductions to Python course. This course will walk participants through the basic functionalities of Python and how it is viewed within the programming world. Unlike the discord bot workshop, all documentation of what we covered in the workshops will be done through Github. 

<b>Goal: </b> The goal for this workshop is to educate participants with the technical skills for Python. We will then prepare participants to work with real data using Riot Games' API.
