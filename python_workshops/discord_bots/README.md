# Discord Bot Workshop 
The first course we hosted was the discord bots workshops. This was a three week course with one hour workshops per week that helped participants set up their Integrated Development Environment (IDE) through PyCharm, downloading the discord.py package, and doing other setup procedures. We then looked into the main commands needed from the package to build a self-sufficient discord beginner bot that we programmed in week 3.

<b>Goal:</b> The goal for this workshop is to educate participants with the skills needed to continue developing the discord bots following the workshops.
