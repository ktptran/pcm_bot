# Introduction to Python Workshops
Following the discord bot workshop, we are now hosting a full introductions to Python course. This course will walk participants through the basic functionalities of Python and how it is viewed within the programming world. Unlike the discord bot workshop, all documentation of what we covered in the workshops will be done through Github. 

<b>Goal: </b> The goal for this workshop is to educate participants with the technical skills for Python. We will then prepare participants to work with real data using Riot Games' API.
