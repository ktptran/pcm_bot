Recording: Released after lecture

## Lecture Concepts
We are covering Riot Games' API today to learn how to extract information from different programming
interfaces.
All of the information covered can be found in the lecture link above and the example Jupyter notebook we went through is here: 
https://github.com/ktptran/pcm_functions/blob/master/python_workshops/intro_python/Workshop%206%20-%20Riot%20Games%20API/Riot%20Games%20API%20Examples.ipynb

We'll be using Jupyter notebook mainly to work with the data. We can then translate this to PyCharm to develop a program.

## Practice Problems
1. How do you get an API key in Riot Games' API?
2. How would you access information from the Riot Games API in browser?
3. How would you access information from the Riot Games API in Python?
4. Explore what information you want to work with in the API and see what you can create!

For more information or any questions, feel free to come stop by office hours at discord.gg/rHKN2sF on Wednesday and Friday from 3-4pm.
