# Workshop Two: Statements
Footnote: We have decided to swap week 2 and week 3 content. So, we will be covering statements (while loops, for loops, if statements, and definitions) before going into data structures.

Having these tools will help you make beginner level programs to give you more tools to program on your own.

Lecture: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Hqs3p0iCXdp98B3oYCCNKF-FEJcPWq6qQZpkO9JNYvo/edit#slide=id.g8347ba00cb_0_333

# Announcements
1. Github repositories will be released at 12:15 on Monday. Repositories will contain indepth information about the concepts.
2. Lectures will start at 12:30.
3. Office hours for coding together and talking about course material 3pm - 4pm on Wednesday and Friday. Office hours will be held in the discord channel: https://discord.gg/rHKN2sF

## Course Goal
The main goal for this course is to build basic programs from Riot Games API where participants will be manipulate data through both Python's basic functions in addition to Python's Pandas.

# Lecture Concepts
Today we will be covering for loops, while loops, if statements, and functions.

Goals for today:
1. Understand the fundamentals of if, for, and while loops
2. Have the skills to make your own functions/definitions

## For loops
For loops are used to iterate over a block of code a fixed number of times.

Example 1: Iterating over a number range.


Example 2: Iterating over a number range from a string.



Example 3: Iterating over a string.


Example 4: Changing iterations.



## Conditional Statements (If statements)
If statements

## While loops
While loops repeat a block of code every time the given statement is true.
while True:
  print

## Functions


## Altogether Examples
General example: https://github.com/ktptran/pcm_functions/blob/master/python_workshops/intro_python/Workshop%202%20-%20Statements/Python%20Combination%20Example%201.ipynb

Using League of Legends/Riot Games API data: https://github.com/ktptran/pcm_functions/blob/master/python_workshops/intro_python/Workshop%202%20-%20Statements/Python%20Combination%20Example%202.ipynb


## Practice problems
1. Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 10 except 3 and 6.
2. Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9. Consider using the random module.
3. Write a Python program that iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For ones that are both divisible by three and five print "fizzbuzz".
4. Write a Python program to print the alphabet pattern 'D'.
5. Write a Python program to print alphabet pattern 'E'.

All programs can be programmed in multiple ways. Solutions can be found in the practice problem solutions ipynb file: https://github.com/ktptran/pcm_functions/blob/master/python_workshops/intro_python/Workshop%202%20-%20Statements/Week%202%20Practice%20Problem%20Solutions.ipynb
