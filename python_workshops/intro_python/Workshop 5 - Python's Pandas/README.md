## Lecture Concepts
We are covering Python's Pandas library today to look at how to work with large datasets.
All of the information covered can be found in the lecture above and the ![.ipynb file](https://github.com/ktptran/pcm_functions/blob/master/python_workshops/intro_python/Workshop%205%20-%20Python's%20Pandas/Workshop%205.ipynb).

Many Python users will predominate to jupyter notebook for data science whereas for programs, we would
use PyCharm.

## Practice Problems
