## Lecture Concepts
We are covering Python's Pandas library today to look at how to work with large datasets.
All of the information covered can be found in the lecture link above and the ![.ipynb file](https://github.com/ktptran/pcm_functions/blob/master/python_workshops/intro_python/Workshop%205%20-%20Python's%20Pandas/Workshop%205.ipynb).

Many Python users will predominate to jupyter notebook for data science whereas for software development programs, we would use PyCharm.

## Practice Problems
Python's Pandas has vast capabilities. To practice, you can find some practice problems with solutions on this site: https://www.machinelearningplus.com/python/101-pandas-exercises-python/
