Recording: Released after lecture


## Lecture Concepts
We will be reviewing the content from the past three weeks.

## Practice Problems
1. Make a program that prints out how many a characters there are in "This is a sentence that contains the utmost atmosphere for all to do."
2. Find all the unique characters in the sentence "This is a sentence that has many animals, we have zebras, kangaroos, pandas, cheetahs, and more!" Disregard capitalization in this problem.
3.  Write an infinite loop. An infinite loop is one that never ends
4. Take 10 integers from the user using a loop and print their average value on the screen
5. Print a multiplication table (10 values) of any value inputted from the user. Can you print it altogether?
6. Write a program to find the prime factor of a number. If a factor of a number is a prime number, then it is its prime factor.
7. Access the value of key 'history' within:
```
sampleDict = {
 "class": {
     "student": {
         "name": "Mike",
         "marks": {
             "physics": 70,
             "history": 80
         }
     }
   }
}
```
8. Make a function to calculate the square value of a number, then use that value again to make the square of it.
9. Rename the key city to location in the following dictionary
```
sampleDict = {
  "name": "Kelly",
  "age":25,
  "salary": 8000,
  "city": "New york"
}
```
Expected Output:
```
{
"name": "Kelly",
"age":25,
"salary": 8000,
"location": "New york"
}
```
10. Check if all items in the following tuple are the same: tuple1 = {45, 45, 45, 45}
Expected output = True

## Solutions
All programs can be solved in multiple ways. ![Solutions](https://github.com/ktptran/pcm_functions/blob/master/python_workshops/intro_python/Workshop%204%20-%20Review/Solutions%20to%20Practice%20Problems.ipynb)
