## Lecture Concepts
Today, we are conducting an experiment using everything we have learned within the Python course.
For data science, we'll use Jupyter Notebook through Anaconda Navigator or colab.

Typically in data science, you'll be conducting many experiments where you're faced with open ended
questions. We'll then use this information to build insight into other factors we have control of.

## Practice Problems
This practice problem will conclude with how you can conduct your own experiments
1. What is something you like doing every day?
2. Can you find any information about it online like an API?
3. What are you wondering about it that you could use data to investigate?
4. Conduct your investigation and good luck!
