Throughout this lecture, we talk about the primitive types, comments, and variables
to develop the basic building blocks of building a program!

# Breakout Room Practice Problem
Using the numerical operations, we learned, figure out how to get:
1. 2 from using 5, 3
2. 0 from 3, 2, 1
3. 2.66 from 5, 3, 2, 3

Evaluate these equations on your own, then check with Python:
1. (3 + 2) / 3 * 2 + 4 % 2
2. (42 / 3) % 2 + 1 - 5
3. (((256 % 2) + (33 % 3) + 33 / 3) * 11) - 1

## Practice Problems
1. Write a program to introduce your name, year, major, how many credits and classes you are taking, your age, your weight, where you live, and your school. All of these have to be in different variables. Then write a story out of it.
2. Write about yourself reading through the Python information section.
3. Answer facts about yourself with True or False following it!
